griyalp

A chatbot for playing pretend. Saves "player info" to a sqlite database; provides randomized toys.

Uses the twitchio library. Uses python 3.12 & asqlite.

Each service is a separate python module in the components directory. The services are loaded in Bot::setup_database, invoked in griyalp.py. 

The twitch_registrar.py is a stripped-down version of the bot
adapted from the twitchio quickstart https://twitchio.dev/en/latest/getting-started/quickstart.html
for registering chat permissions without spinning up a database
